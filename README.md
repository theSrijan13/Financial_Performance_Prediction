# Financial Performance Prediction Project

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the financial performance of companies based on historical financial data. The model utilizes various financial indicators and metrics to forecast future performance, providing insights for investors and financial analysts.

## Folder Structure:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for the machine learning model implementation.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Usage:

Data Preparation:

Ensure that your dataset is in the data/ folder.
Modify the data loading and preprocessing steps in the Jupyter notebooks (notebooks/) as needed.
Model Training:

Run the Jupyter notebooks (notebooks/) to train and evaluate the model.
Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Prediction:

Once the model is trained, use the provided scripts in the src/ folder for making predictions on new data
